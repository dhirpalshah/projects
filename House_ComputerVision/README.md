how to run:

1. activate the virtual environment `pythonvenv` by running `source pythonvenv/bin/activate`
- note: the venv has been removed due to the substantial size... run `python3 -m venv nameofvenv` then `source nameofvenv/bin/activate`. You may need to manually `python3 -m pip install` certain dependencies.
3. run the following command if the processed images are not already in the folder: `python3 image_segmentation.py`
4. wait for the program to run, and it should output processed images from the `images` folder into the main directory

note: if you're running this for the first time, you should already see the premade processed images in the main directory.
