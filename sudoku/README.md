sudoku solver:

i'd rather have computer solve sudoku than have to solve it myself.

how it works:
Left Click --> select box
Enter --> confirms entered value
Delete --> deletes the value
Space --> autosolve

interesting stuff:
the pathfinding algorithm i used here is the backtracking algo.
basically goes through until it realizes it is wrong and then restarts.
